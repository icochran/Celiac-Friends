      <h3>Celiac Friends was created by Isabelle Cochran, a junior at Middlebury College. She was first diagnosed with Celiac Disease in 6th grade and has a little sister who was diagnosed a few years later. Isabelle wanted to create a website that could connect a large community of people to share their knowledge and experience to help others on a gluten free diet.</h3>
